# JavaScript_code003
Third code made while practicing JavaScript. This one's a bit longer but not that complicated. Had some problems with the whole "var x + 100;" in the middle of the code. It just wouldn't work, so I decided to use "var x += 100;" and of course... it started working. Don't know the reason yet but... if it works, it works.

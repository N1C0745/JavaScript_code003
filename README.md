# JavaScript_code003
Third code made while practicing JavaScript. This one's a bit longer but not that complicated. Had some problems with the whole "var x + 100;" in the middle of the code. It just wouldn't work, so I decided to use "var x += 100;" and of course... it started working. Don't know the reason yet but... if it works, it works.



This code reads the values (from user's input) necessary to complete the following calculus: J = C * i * t
[making sure the "time" and "rate" remain in the same time period].

Also, depending on the values given, the code needs to return the value that has been missing from the equation ('?').


Ex.: J = 120; C = 480; t = 6 months; i = ?

Answer: i = 0.04166... => ~ 4,17% p.m. (per month).
